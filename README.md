# Career Assistant

Welcome to our Personalized career assistant agent! This app leverages the power of Gemini AI to generate tailored journeys that help users achieve their career goals, no matter their starting point. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, our app provides a structured path to success, complete with certifications, portfolio projects, and soft-skill development tailored to your needs, opportunities and events.

## Features

### 1. Personalized Onboarding
When you first launch the app, you'll be prompted to sign up and complete an onboarding process. During this process, we collect important details such as:
- **Education Level**
- **Career of Interest**
- **Disabilities (if any)**

You also have the option to upload your resume to help further personalize your learning experience. For example, if you select autism as a disability, the app will adapt its recommendations to your needs.

### 2. AI-Generated Learning Roadmap
After onboarding, our advanced Gemini AI generates a comprehensive roadmap for your chosen area of expertise. Your roadmap will guide you through a learning journey from beginner to advanced levels, offering:
- **Structured Learning Pathways**: Each level contains subjects that you need to master.
- **Course Recommendations**: Courses from leading platforms like Edx and Udemy are recommended, including a mix of free and paid options to remove cost barriers.

### 3. Tailored Soft-Skill Courses
In addition to technical skills, the app also recommends soft-skill courses. These courses are tailored to your specific needs:
- **For Users with Disabilities**: Soft-skill courses are customized to address the unique challenges you may face. For example, autistic users may receive courses specifically designed to help them thrive.
- **For Users without Disabilities**: Regular soft-skill courses are provided to ensure well-rounded development.

### 4. Certifications and Real-World Projects
At the end of each level, the app encourages you to obtain relevant certifications and complete projects that can help build your portfolio. These projects are designed to solve real-world problems and could potentially lead to new career opportunities or even a startup.

### 5. Learning Streaks and Milestones
To keep you motivated and on track, the app offers:
- **Learning Streaks**: Schedule your learning sessions and let our AI-powered agent, Sia, remind you when it's time to study.
- **Milestones and Trophies**: Reach learning milestones and earn trophies as you progress.

### 6. Gamified Streak Completion
After each learning session, you can complete your streak by answering questions related to what youâ€™ve learned. Gemini AI will score your performance using a cognitive load technique to ensure genuine learning. This gamified approach makes the learning process engaging and fun.
- **Remarkable feature**: We leverage Gemini AI to score the user streak progress using a built-in **truth detector** that inposes cognitive load on the user by asking the user multiple questions about what they learned and scores the user based on how well the user answers the questions.
